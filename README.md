# openMINDS_core

The **openMINDS_core** repository is part of the **open** **M**etadata **I**nitiative for **N**euroscience **D**ata Structures (**openMINDS**). It contains 
schemas used to describe the general origin, location and content of neuroscience research products. The openMINDS_core schemas cover metadata for the basic integration of research products into the EBRAINS Knowledge Graph.

The major versions are developed and maintained in different version-branches. **Each version can be accessed by checking out the corresponding version-branch.** You are currently on **version-branch v1**. Note: the default branch is always the latest version-branch in use within the EBRAINS Knowledge Graph. 

**!!! THIS VERSION IS DEPRECATED !!!** openMINDS_core v1 was a first attempt to more consistently capture the schemas used in the EBRAINS Knowledge Graph. It does not store the schemas in a functional correct format, and does not follow the official structure of the openMINDS metadata model version branches. Changes in here will not lead to a new build of the central openMINDS repository.

For application and technical details for newer openMINDS versions please go to the [central openMINDS repository](https://github.com/HumanBrainProject/openMINDS) or the [openMINDS Collab](https://wiki.ebrains.eu/bin/view/Collabs/openminds/).
